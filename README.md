# Hi, I'm Amber üëã

I‚Äôm a detail-oriented and results-driven aspiring Data Analyst with practical experience in data analysis, reporting automation, and process optimization. I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable insights using advanced Excel (including macros, VBA, and Power Query), Power BI, Smartsheet, and SQL.

### Key Strengths:
- Expertise in automating dashboards and reports to enhance operational efficiency and ensure data accuracy
- Proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization for clear, impactful communication
- Strong background in process improvement supported by documentation and training to empower teams
- Experience creating multi-dimensional reports and interactive dashboards using Power BI and Smartsheet
- Ability to write SQL queries for data extraction and analysis to support decision-making

Currently, I work at Liberty Mutual Insurance, where I have developed automated Excel tools that reduced manual processing times by over 75%, built Power BI dashboards, and led training programs to improve team productivity. The projects featured in this portfolio represent self-initiated efforts‚Äîeither driven by identified needs or requests from colleagues and managers‚Äîshowcasing my proactive approach and commitment to continuous improvement beyond formal job responsibilities.

I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover business insights and continuously advancing my technical skillset. Feel free to explore my repositories, which highlight projects in data cleaning, automation, visualization, and reporting.
